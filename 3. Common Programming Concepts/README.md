### Notes
The tuple without any values, (), is a special type that has only one value, also written (). The type is called the unit type and the value is called the unit value. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.

The primary situation in which you’d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value. Let’s look at some examples.
If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.

Using too many else if expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called match for these cases.
