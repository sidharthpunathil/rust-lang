### Notes
The tuple without any values, (), is a special type that has only one value, also written (). The type is called the unit type and the value is called the unit value. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.

The primary situation in which you’d use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.
